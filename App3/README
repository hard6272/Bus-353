Reviewer 1:

Project used camera gadget, found in chapter 7, page 154-155.

Line 41: Missing ‘  ‘ around “#fff”
Line 44: “Ti.UI.CreateView” misspelled as “TI.UI.CreateView”
Line 57: “Ti.UI.createTab” misspelled as “TI.UI.createTab”
Lines 117-124: “Missing semicolon” error on lines 117, 122, 123. 

App appears to be structured appropriately, but does not function. App only shows black screen with bottom tab and no visible functions. May be due to placement of “.add” functions for tabs/windows.
